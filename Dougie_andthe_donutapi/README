Dougie the Donut and Pizza Rat are now best buds taking New York City by storm. Now instead of causing trouble against each other, they've taken it upon themselves to cause trouble around the city! The catch is, they don't want to get caught by the police (in other words, they want to eat their cake and have it, too) so they've put their brains together to come up with a helpful app idea that will allow them to see what kind of trouble they can cause without getting thrown in jail.

This app searches through the 311 call data provided by the NYC Open Data API and will display all the complaints made to the NYPD, filtered by borough. Dougie and Pizza Rat also want to see how the police responded to the complaint, so they will be able to see each response for each complaint. This is what they'll use to determine whether or not they can cause the same trouble without consequences!
